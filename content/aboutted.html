<h2>About TED: </h2>
<strong style="color:#F00;">TED</strong> is a nonprofit devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. It started out (in 1984) as a conference bringing together people from three worlds: <em>Technology, Entertainment, Design</em>. Since then its scope has become ever broader. Along with two annual conferences &ndash; the TED Conference in Long Beach and Palm Springs each spring, and the TEDGlobal conference in Edinburgh UK each summer &ndash; TED includes the award-winning TEDTalks video site, the Open Translation Project and TED Conversations, the inspiring TED Fellows and TEDx programs, and the annual TED Prize.<br />

<h2>About TEDx:</h2>
 In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called <strong style="color:#F00;">TEDx</strong>. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED &ndash; like experience. Our event is called TEDxStockholm, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxStockholm event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized. For more information about the TEDx-platform please watch this beautifully inspiring video below:</p><br />
