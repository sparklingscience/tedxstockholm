<h2>Why TEDxStockholm?</h2>
The Swedish welfare system, a world-class educational system and a non-hierarchical working environment have enabled Sweden to be a country ranking high on innovation and Stockholm as an emerging capital of innovation. The city is blessed with a strong creative and innovative mindset -the Stockholm mindset. Today, however, Stockholm is lacking a natural open forum where people can meet and ideas worth spreading can evolve. There is also a lack of insight in the true value and potential of the Stockholm mindset. TEDxStockholm is our way of creating such a forum and spreading this insight.

<h2>Our purpose</h2>
We want to further promote the innovative and transparent nature of the Stockholm mindset to make Stockholm the capital of innovation. At the same time we want to act as a facilitator for knowledge-sharing by bringing the TED mindset to Stockholm. We believe this will be achieved by creating a physical forum, an open think tank, where curious and open-minded individuals can meet and let ideas and concepts evolve, take tangible form and come alive!<br />

<h1>TEDx is a 21st century place for the domains of education, innovation, artistry, design, science and entrepreneurship where these concepts are allowed to continuously evolve and be re-imagined into newer and ever changing forms.</h1>
